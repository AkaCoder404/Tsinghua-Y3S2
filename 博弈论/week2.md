## Safety Strategies

pure strategy

equilibrium: BR to each other

minimaxx theoream

- For Player I: find p so that $Min_q p^T A q$ is the largest value. $p$ is called the safety strategy or optimal strategy 
- For Player 2: ...

safety strategy, safety principle

value of game - saddle point 

saddle points, br to each other in pure strategies

maximum principle, find risk for each strategy, then find safety strategy with minimum risk

X* and Y* mixed strategies

maxmini for player 1

minimax for player 2







## Equivalence of the Maximin Principle and the Equilibrium Principle 



whatever you use, you must use a best response

- can have multiple best responses rows/columns, but have to be equal

principle of indifference - gives the following recipe to find all the best response strategy to a given strategy

equilibrium pair, equilibrium strategies
